## The Botnbot Application

The Botnbot Application allows you to track your sites performance and uptime.

The front-end is a single page application written using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/).

It's still in a very alpha state. Don't use it in production !

### Dependencies

### Quicklaunch for Development

With Node.js installed, run the following lines from the root of your project :

```sh

gulp serve
```

Note : the Botnbot Nexus must run and listen to port 3000
