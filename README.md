## Developing

Start the webpack-dev-server on localhost http://localhost:8081 with hot-reload

```
npm run dev
```

## Building Your Application

```
$ npm run build:prod
```

This will create builds of your application in the `dist/` directory, optimized to be served in production. You can then serve the built version :

```
$ npm run serve
```
